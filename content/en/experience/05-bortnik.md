- Engineered two **PyTorch**-based concepts resulting in a voice cloning model patent application.
- Developed and validated TTS & Voice Cloning models: **Tacotron 2**, WaveRNN, SpeakerVerification2TTS, and Transformer-based architectures.
- Conducted **DeepFace/FaceNet** experiments for demographic recognition (gender, age, height, weight) from visual data.
- Implemented high-performance data collection pipelines using **Asyncio** for high-volume image scraping.
- Managed large-scale model training across **Google Colab** and **Paperspace** environments.
