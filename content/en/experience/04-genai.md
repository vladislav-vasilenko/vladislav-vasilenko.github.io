- Researched and implemented Bark-like **AR-Transformers** (EnCodec) and StableAudio-like latent diffusion (**DiT** on EnCodec); explored VAE + RVQ/VQ quantizers for audio latent representations.
- Analyzed and adapted building blocks from `stable-audio-tools`: dit.py / encodec.py / conditioners.py. Compared DiT architectures with **SDXL** (UNet) and **Flux** (DiT) backbones.
- Optimized model adaptation by identifying ideal layers for **LoRA** and tuning rank/regularization parameters for quality/resource efficiency.
- Applied **PEFT (LoRA/QLoRA)** for rapid domain, voice, and genre adaptation; conducted extensive ablations on rank and data selection.
- Established rigorous quality evaluation using **FAD**, **CLAPScore**, FID, CLIPScore, and FVD.
- Engineered reproducible ML pipelines from data preparation to batch inference, logging performance in **W&B**.
- Optimized inference using **xFormers/Flash-Attention** and specialized diffusion schedulers; developed Gradio demos.
- Spearheaded MLOps initiatives: **Docker + CI/CD**, monitoring, and experimental exports to ONNX/Triton for production.
