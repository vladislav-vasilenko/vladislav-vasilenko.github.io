Experienced ML/DL engineer focused on generative models: Diffusion, Flow-Matching, DiT. Worked with SDXL and Flux architectures, applied LoRA/QLoRA for adaptation, experimented with ControlNet and IP-Adapter.

Build reproducible pipelines (Hydra, MLflow, W&B), optimize inference (xFormers, Flash-Attention, scheduler tuning) and prepare models for production (Docker, CI/CD, Triton, ONNX).

Proficient in PyTorch and Python with experience in LLM, LangChain and cloud infrastructure (SageMaker, GCP, Paperspace).
