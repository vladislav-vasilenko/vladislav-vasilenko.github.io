My passion is turning high-end technologies into products that impact daily life. I believe the most valuable engineering happens where cutting-edge research meets real users — when a Transformer model becomes a tool that saves someone hours of work, or when an optimized inference pipeline makes AI accessible on everyday hardware.

I continuously grow my skills side by side with professionals in a fast-evolving technology environment. I design modern products using Deep Learning & Machine Learning techniques alongside the mathematical structures that describe data processing — tensors, matrices, and n-dimensional vector spaces.

I study scientific literature and specialized Arxiv papers on the latest technologies. I am inspired by teams like Google DeepMind, Yandex, and Meta FAIR, ACM presentations, and other authors pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

In my free time, I am actively involved in sports — swimming, running; I study English and use it in my work.
