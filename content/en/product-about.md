Quote from former Microsoft CTO: "Software is a gas that expands to fill the available computing volume," or why Moore's Law still holds true.

I am inspired by the creation and development of unique products. If a product can solve a problem for millions of users, it means my contribution truly saves time and develops the user community.

Additionally, I study scientific literature and specialized Arxiv papers on the latest technologies. I am inspired by scientific teams like Google DeepMind, Yandex, and Meta FAIR, ACM presentations, and other authors of scientific and technical articles.

In my free time, I am actively involved in sports — swimming, running; I study English and use it in my work.
